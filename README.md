# JavaScript Tutorial

Hello!  The purpose of this repository is to provide you with a few simple resources to learn the basics of JavaScript.

## See your code!

The first and probably most important thing in this repo is the `console.log()` function.  When you run `console.log()`, it will take whatever arguments you put in the function and print them in your browser's console.  Like so:

Sweet!  But, you need to know how to access your browser's console in order to see this print. I will explain how to view the console in [Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html#brand=CHMB&utm_campaign=en&utm_source=en-ha-na-us-sk&utm_medium=ha).

Right click on the page (anywhere) and click on `inspect element`.

You're now in Chrome's developer tools.  Woo!  There are a lot of really powerful tools here, but we're going to just focus on the console.  At the top of the new pane that opens up, there should be a tab labelled `console`.  Click on that to have access to the console.

Welcome to the console.  From here, you can view anything that prints to the console (`console.log()`, errors, warnings, etc.) or even run JavaScript directly.  You will spend a lot of time in the console when developing. If there are ever unexpected or unhandled errors, they will appear here.  This will help you to understand your code much better.

You can (and should) use the console in context of JSFiddle as well.  You can write your code like normal in the bottom left quadrant.  If you want to see the results of your code, you can `console.log()` the result and now see the results...

right in your console.
