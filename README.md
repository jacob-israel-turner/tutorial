# JavaScript Tutorial

Hello!  The purpose of this repository is to provide you with a few simple resources to learn the basics of JavaScript.

## See your code!

The first and probably most important thing in this repo is the `console.log()` function.  When you run `console.log()`, it will take whatever arguments you put in the function and print them in your browser's console.  Like so:

Sweet!  But, you need to know how to access your browser's console in order to see this print. I will explain how to view the console in [Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html#brand=CHMB&utm_campaign=en&utm_source=en-ha-na-us-sk&utm_medium=ha).

Right click on the page (anywhere) and click on `inspect element`.

You're now in Chrome's developer tools.  Woo!  There are a lot of really powerful tools here, but we're going to just focus on the console.  At the top of the new pane that opens up, there should be a tab labelled `console`.  Click on that to have access to the console.
